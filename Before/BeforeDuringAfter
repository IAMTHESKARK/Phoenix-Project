        <h1>What to do during natural disasters</h1>
        <p>There are many types of natural disasters that can impact
            communities
            around the world. Some of the most common types include:
            Tornadoes,
            Hurricanes(also known as cyclones or typhoons based on
            location),
            Earthquakes, and Floods.
            However, quick and effective action can help mitigate the impact
            of
            these events. Here are some general guidelines on what to do
            during
            these natural disasters:</p>
        <div class="tornado">
            <h2>Tornadoes</h2>
            <h3>Before</h3>
            <p>Create an emergency kit with essentials like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Water (1 gallon per person per day)</li>
                    <li>Non-perishable food</li>
                    <li>Medications</li>
                    <li>Flashlight</li>
                    <li>Batteries</li>
                    <li>Emergency radio</li>
                    <li>Important documents</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            Identify a
            safe room in your home, such as a basement or an interior room on
            the
            lowest floor without windows. Making a plan will reduce panic and
            protect families from harm, especially by preventing family members
            by
            going out into the storm to look for each other.
            `<h3>During</h3>
            <p>During a tornado, seek shelter immediately in a basement or an
                interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid
                windows and cover yourself with a mattress or heavy blankets to
                protect against debris. If outside, lie down in a low-lying
                area,
                preferable a ditch, and cover your head with your hands. Never
                try to outrun a tornado, even in a car. If in a vehicle or a non-sturdy building, abandon
                it for the nearest sturdy building.</p>
            <h3>After</h3>
            <p>After a tornado, check yourself and others for injuries and
                provide first aid as needed. Avoid downed power lines and report
                them to the utility company. Stay informed through local news
                and weather updates. Be cautious when entering damaged buildings
                and avoid using matches or lighters in case of gas leaks.</p>   
            </div>
    <div class="hurricanes">
        <h3>Before</h3>
        <p>Secure your home by boarding up windows and reinforcing doors.
            Create an emergency kit with essentials like water, non-perishable
            food, medications, flashlight, batteries, an emergency radio, and
            important documents. Develop an evacuation plan and know your
            evacuation routes. Stay informed about weather updates and heed
            evacuation orders from local authorities.</p>
        <h3>During</h3>
        <p>During a hurricane, stay indoors and away from windows. If you are
            in a mobile home or a weak structure, evacuate to a designated
            shelter or a sturdy building. If you are in a car and cannot find
            shelter, pull over and stay in your vehicle with the windows up.
            Do not drive through flooded roads or attempt to outrun the storm.
            If you are in an area prone to flooding, move to higher ground.</p>
        <h3>After</h3>
        <p>After a hurricane, check yourself and others for injuries and
            provide first aid as needed. Avoid downed power lines and report
            them to the utility company. Stay informed through local news
            and weather updates. Be cautious when entering damaged buildings
            and avoid using matches or lighters in case of gas leaks.</p>
    </div>
<div id="floods">
        <h2>Floods</h2>
        <h3>Before</h3>
        <p>Know your flood risk and have an evacuation plan in place. Create
            an emergency kit with essentials like water, non-perishable food,
            medications, flashlight, batteries, an emergency radio, and
            important documents. Elevate electrical appliances and utilities
            above potential flood levels. Stay informed about weather updates
            and heed evacuation orders from local authorities.</p>
        <h3>During</h3>
        <p>During a flood, move to higher ground immediately. Avoid walking
            or driving through floodwaters, as they can be deeper and more
            dangerous than they appear. If you are in a vehicle and floodwaters
            rise around you, abandon the vehicle and seek higher ground.
            Listen to local news and weather updates for information on road
            closures and evacuation routes.</p>
        <h3>After</h3>
        <p>After a flood, check yourself and others for injuries and provide
            first aid as needed. Avoid downed power lines and report them to
            the utility company. Stay informed through local news and weather
            updates. Be cautious when entering damaged buildings and avoid
            using matches or lighters in case of gas leaks.</p>
