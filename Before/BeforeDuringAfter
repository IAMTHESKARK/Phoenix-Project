        <h1>What to do during natural disasters</h1>
        <p>There are many types of natural disasters that can impact
            communities
            around the world. Some of the most common types include:
            Tornadoes,
            Hurricanes(also known as cyclones or typhoons based on
            location),
            Earthquakes, and Floods.
            However, quick and effective action can help mitigate the impact
            of
            these events. Here are some general guidelines on what to do
            during
            these natural disasters:</p>
        <div class="tornado">
            <h2>Tornadoes</h2>
            <h3>Before</h3>
            <p>Create an emergency kit with essentials like water,
                non-perishable
                food,
                medications, flashlight, batteries, an emergency radio, and important documents.</p>
            Identify a
            safe room in your home, such as a basement or an interior room on
            the
            lowest floor without windows. Making a plan will reduce panic and
            protect families from harm, especially by preventing family members
            by
            going out into the storm to look for each other.
            `<h3>During</h3>
            <p>During a tornado, seek shelter immediately in a basement or an
                interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid
                windows and cover yourself with a mattress or heavy blankets to
                protect against debris. If outside, lie down in a low-lying
                area,
                preferable a ditch, and cover your head with your hands. Never
                try to outrun a tornado, even in a car. If in a vehicle or a non-sturdy building, abandon
                it for the nearest sturdy building.</p>
            <h3>After</h3>
            <p>After a tornado, check yourself and others for injuries and
                provide first aid as needed. Avoid downed power lines and report
                them to the utility company. Stay informed through local news
                and weather updates. Be cautious when entering damaged buildings
                and avoid using matches or lighters in case of gas leaks.</p>
